Getting started.
----------------

1.  Read the UTF-X manual.  You'll find a rendered version under dist/manual 
    and the latest version at http://utf-x.sourceforge.net/manual/

2.  Browse through three sample applications provided with this distribution.
    You will find these in the samples directory. Rendered versions of the samples
    (HTML and PDF) are in the rendered_samples directory.  You can run the samples
    by executing the 'samples' ant target: ant samples.
    
We hope you'll enjoy test driven XSLT development with UTF-X.
